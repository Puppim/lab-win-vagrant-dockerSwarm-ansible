# Lab vagrant Docker Swarm on windows with Ansible
### This lab has vagrant, Docker Swarm and Ansible. As in this laboratory we use vagrant on windows that does not have a good support for the use of Ansible, we present a solution for the assembly of the laboratory with Ansible on windows

 The machine with ansible will execute the command on the master node of Dockerswarm as a demonstration it will just be a service with hello world

## To run: ``` vagrant up```
